# Predicting House Prices in Boston Massachusetts using Multivariate Linear Regression 
![](https://i.imgur.com/WKQ0nH2.jpg)

Welcome to one of my favourite Capstone projects in my Python coursework. Imagine we're working for a real estate developer in the 1970s, and our boss wants to know how much the completed housing project will be worth. 

We are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:
* The number of rooms
* The distance to employment centres
* How rich or poor the area is
* How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc

## ðŸ›  Skills
- Python (Jupyter)
- Pandas library
- Numpy library
- Seaborn library
- Plotly Express library
- Scikit-learn Linear Regression & Model Selection



## Tasks Accomplished

- Analyse and explore the Boston house price data
- Split the data for training and testing
- Run a Multivariable Regression
- Evaluate the model's coefficients and residuals
- Use data transformation to improve model performance
- Use the model to estimate property prices
